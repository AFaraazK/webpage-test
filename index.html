        <h1>The Basics of Building a Good Setting</h1>
        <h3><em>Only plan for the essentials, you can improvise the rest</em></h3>

        <p>As the morning sun crests over the jagged mountaintops, your
            party enters the tavern, looking for... wait what was the mayor
            called again? The tavern name? I'm not sure, give me a second...
        </p>

        <p>As a writer, and especially as a DM you have to go through a number
            of different settings, preparing each one just enough that the players 
            are able to follow their quest, without waiting as you hurriedly
            trying to come up with names and descriptions. But what do you need to
            focus on? How do you build a setting that feels complete without spending
            a Tolkein-esque amount sat around a map?
        </p>
